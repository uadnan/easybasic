# ASCII
This is a list of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). ASCII only covers 128 characters and defines the code point ranges `&h00`â€“`&h1F` and `&h7F` as control characters which do not have a printable glyph assigned to them. This includes such values as the Carriage Return (`CR`) character that ends a program line.

In the context of this documentation, character `&h1A` (SUB) will usually be indicated as EOF since it plays the role of end-of-file marker in DOS.
