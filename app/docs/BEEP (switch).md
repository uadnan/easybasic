# BEEP (switch)
`BEEP {ON|OFF}`

This statement has no effect.

##Notes
* Only legal with the `syntax={pcjr|tandy}` option.
* On PCjr and Tandy computers, `BEEP OFF` would turn off the internal speaker. On PC-BASIC, both the internal and the external speaker are emulated through the same sound system.
