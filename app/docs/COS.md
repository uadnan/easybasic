# COS
`cosine = COS(angle)`
Returns the cosine of `angle`. Unless PC-BASIC is run with the `double` option, this function returns a single-precision value.

## Parameters
* `angle` is a numeric expression that gives the angle in radians.
## Notes
* The return value usually differs from the value returned by GW-BASIC in the least significant figure.
## Errors
* `angle` has a string value: `Type mismatch`.
