# SIN
`sine = SIN(angle)`

Returns the sine of `angle`.

## Parameters
* `angle` is a numeric expression giving the angle in radians.
## Notes
* Unless PC-BASIC is run with the `double` option, this function returns a single-precision value.
* The sine returned usually differs from the value returned by GW-BASIC in the least significant figure.
## Errors
* `angle` has a string value: `Type mismatch`.
